Code Refactoring
==================================

1.  Redesigned the project structure: Team “Bulls and Cows”
    -   Renamed the project to "BullsAndCows".
    -   Renamed the main class `Proekt` to `Game`.
    -   Extracted each class in a separate file with a good name: `GameFifteen.cs`, `Board.cs`, `Point.cs`.
